<h1>Lesson 2: Thinking in HTML</h2>
  <p>Berners-Lee developed HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and in conjunction, he 
    developed a protocol to access text from other documents via hyperlinks. The protocol was 
    called HTTP, and this paved the way for the future. HTML itself was derived from a markup 
    language called Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).
    Standardization being an ongoing process, modifications were constantly made and 
    versions were released accordingly. The various versions of HTML that have been released 
    are as follows: </p>
      <p>   &#10022; HTML 2.0 (November 1995)</p>
      <p>   &#10022;3.2 (January 1997)</p>
      <p>   &#10022;4.0 (December 1997)</p>
      <p>   &#10022;4.01 (December 1999)</p>
      <p>   &#10022;HTML5, which is widely used, but is still in the development stage</p>
