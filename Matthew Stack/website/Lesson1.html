  This book provides you with an intermediate knowledge of HTML. Instead of wandering 
through loads of theory, we will understand HTML practically so that we can understand the 
markup of a web page. We have used Notepad for the examples in this book. Alternatively, 
you can also use Notepad++ or any advanced editor. All you need to do is copy the code and 
paste it into Notepad. Upon execution, you will get the output as depicted in the screenshots. 
Screenshots are provided for each piece of sample code.
Coding improves with practice. The examples in this book are compatible with almost every 
modern browser such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome, to name a few. Instead of using 
the verbatim code, you can modify the code and see the change in the output, thereby 
understanding the subtle nuances of HTML. By the end of the book, with practice, you can 
achieve better things as you get to grips with HTML.

<p>HTML originated from a prototype created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992. Berners-Lee felt that 
  there was a possibility of linking documents together by the use of hypertext, and the concept 
  of HTML evolved. The drawback was that the commercial hypertext packages available at that 
  time, such as Zog and Intermedia, were customized to suit different types of computers and 
  were too ambiguous in nature</p>
